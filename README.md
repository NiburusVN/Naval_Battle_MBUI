**! IMPORTANT ! This project is an old project that i transfer in GitHub because i used only GitLab and my local repositories from my laptop.**

#	[Naval Battle]



## Introduction :

During the highschool in 2022, i had to develop my first real game without game engine like Unity nor Godot. 
I was with my partner Amine Belhaj and we worked on this project for 1 month only. 
So we used to manage our stress due to the pression of our teacher and the deadline !


## What about this game :

Naval Battle is a funny game that we call in France (jeu de société) to play against a friend. So basically, this game isn't intuitive but i we can explain only in one word : STRATEGY !


## A little look of the UI of the game :
